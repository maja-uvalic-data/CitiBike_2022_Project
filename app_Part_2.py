        The dark blue line shows the **exact number of Citi Bike trips per day**, while the light blue line shows the

        We can see that:
        - **Seasonal effect:** Warmer months show higher trip volumes, indicating a strong relationship between temperature and ridership.

        - **Operational pressure:** Sustained high demand in summer months may challenge bike availability and require more intensive redistribution.

        - **Trend clarity with 7-day average:** The 7-day moving average highlights the overall seasonal trend and helps filter out daily noise for clearer interpretation.

    ### Interpretation
    This heatmap shows at which hours and on which days Citi Bike demand peaks.

    - **Weekday rush hours (7–9 AM, 4–7 PM)** are the highest points of demand.
    - **Weekend usage is more spread out**, centered around late morning and afternoon.
    - This pattern is critical for supply planning:
        - Boost bike supply in central Manhattan during rush hours.
        - Bring more bikes to recreational areas on weekends.
        - Redistribution teams should focus on commuter patterns.

    This chart supports a clear plan to optimize Citi Bike availability across NYC.
    """)

elif page == "Recommendations":
    st.header("Recommendations")

    st.markdown("""
    Based on the overall analysis of Citi Bike usage patterns in New York City, 
    several clear opportunities emerge for optimizing bike supply and improving system efficiency.

    ### 1. Increase bike availability during weekday rush hours  
    The strongest peaks occur on **weekdays between 7–9 AM and 4–7 PM**, driven by commuters.  
    - Focus bike redistribution teams in **Midtown, Downtown, and Lower Manhattan**.  
    - Prepare these stations with higher bike inventory before rush hour starts.

    ### 2. Strengthen supply in high-demand central stations  
    Both the map and bar charts show that usage is highest in the **central business district**.  
    - These zones need **double the supply** compared to outer areas.  
    - Consider adding temporary or pop-up docking capacity during busy seasons.

    ### 3. Adjust weekend supply for recreational demand  
    Weekends show **late-morning and early-afternoon peaks**, especially near parks and waterfronts.  
    - Reallocate bikes toward areas like **Central Park, Hudson River Greenway, and Brooklyn waterfront**.  
    - Less focus needed on commuting hot-spots during weekends.

    ### 4. Improve overnight bike redistribution  
    Data indicates significant imbalance by the end of the day.  
    - Implement automated overnight balancing routes.  
    - Use predictive modeling to prepare inventory for the next day’s rush hours.

    ### 5. Use historical patterns to forecast future demand  
    The consistent seasonality and hourly patterns provide a strong basis for predictive planning.  
    - Leverage machine learning or time-series forecasting for bike distribution schedules.  
    - Combine this with weather forecasts, which significantly influence demand.

    ### Conclusion  
    With strategic redistribution, time-dependent supply planning, and predictive insights, 
    Citi Bike can significantly reduce shortages and improve availability across New York City.
