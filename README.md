## Project Summary
Citi Bike is New York City’s largest bike-sharing system, and its demand has grown rapidly since 
launching in 2013—especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This increased usage has also led to 
distribution challenges, such as empty docks at busy stations and stations that are too full to 
return a bike. The goal of this project is to analyze Citi Bike’s 2022 trip data, enriched with 
weather information, to understand when and why these imbalances occur. The insights from this 
analysis will help identify the root causes of distribution issues and guide management toward 
data-driven solutions.

## Data Used
This project uses two main data sources:
- **Citi Bike Trip Data (2022):** Publicly available data including ride duration, station usage, and rider types.  
- **NOAA Weather Data (2022):** Daily temperature data collected through NOAA’s API.  

These two datasets were merged to analyze how weather conditions influence bike usage patterns 
and to better understand the root causes of distribution challenges.

**Note:** Due to the large size of the original Citi Bike datasets, only a cleaned sample of the 
2022 data is included in this repository. The full dataset exceeds GitHub’s file size limits.


## Folders
- **Data** – raw and prepared datasets  
- **Notebooks** – analysis notebooks  
- **Scripts** – currently empty; reserved for future Python scripts
